    "Data from twitter was gathered in four subsets to construct the main dataset. The purpose for this was to compose a diverse set of viewpoints. The subsets can be organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Baseline: These were tweets from news organizations such as the NY Times and Washington Post. While they have editorial boards, both publications are often regarded as the standard in American journalism. By including their tweets, the hope was to gather an unbiased viewpoint on the Covid Pandemic. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pole1: This group of text data set contains all tweets authored by Donald J. Trump that met the search criteria of Covid and Pandemic. By collecting these items, we can see what strategy the administration is using and with the Public and Baseline subsets monitor how it is being received in the public. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pole2: Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York, received lots of attention for his public appeals to control the outbreak when it first hit his state earlier this year. Many in the media also commented that his approach was the complete opposite of President Trump's strategy. Collecting these items provides the dataset with this viewpoint and also allows for one to track if the Cuomo or Trump approach is the preferred route to dealing with Covid. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public: This subset includes all tweets published by individuals in the English language that met the search criteria of Covid-19 and USA. By collecting such tweets from the public, we can better understand public reaction in real-time. Further, this subset of tweets can be juxtaposed with the Pole1 and Pole2 groups of tweets to see what political messaging is grabbing hold amongst the citizenry.\n",
